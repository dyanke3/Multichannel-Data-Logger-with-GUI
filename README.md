# Summary
The device shown below was made as a final year project for my studies. Main goal was to design a system, which could be used to monitor a fixed environment with a capability to log the data in a storage peripheral. In the end, after a few revisions, a functional multichannel logging device was achieved, here's a list of what it can do:
* Supports up to 8 sensors (channels) connected at once.
* Different interface sensors can be integrated into the system, including I<sup>2</sup>C, UART (Receive only) and analog signal sensing components.
* The Logger is able to automatically identify the connected peripherals and determine the slot, to which they are connected. 
*
